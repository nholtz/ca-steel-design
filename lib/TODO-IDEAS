Implement a cell line magic '%S' to take the place of show.

instead of:

show('Dsg,B,T,D,B,W,*1E3,Sx,Zx,J,*1E6,Ix,Iy,*1E9,Cw','*1,Fy,E,G')

do:

%S Dsg,B,T,D,B,W,*1E3,Sx,Zx,J,*1E6,Ix,Iy,*1E9,Cw,*1,Fy,E,G

(numbers imply scaling following entries)

================================================================

Make outputs like the above accumulate until the end of cell is reached
